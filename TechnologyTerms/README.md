- **Build** : the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifact(s) that can be run on a computer.
- **Segfault** : Segmentation fault, which occurs when a program attempts to access a [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory) location that it is not allowed to access, or attempts to access a memory location in a way that is not allowed (for example, attempting to write to a [read-only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory) location, or to overwrite part of the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)).
